# Amit Kurud's dotfiles

This is my config for my ghostty, wezterm, tmux, .zshrc

Use this on your own RISK as this is continuously getting modified, what might be running on my system might not run on yours :)

For neovim, I am using astronvim config, in addition to the few of the additional plugin, This might be replaced with my own config in Near future
